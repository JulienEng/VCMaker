## Welcome to the home of VCMaker

The **V**ibronic **C**oupling **Maker** is a piece of code developped by Julien Eng, currently a PDRA in the Penfold Group at Newcastle University ([Click here to know more!](http://www.penfoldgroup.co.uk/))

### Features

**VCMaker** aims at extracting all the parameters needed to build a Linear Vibronic Coupling Hamiltonian from ab initio calculations.
The first version of **VCMaker** will allow to:
* Extract the intrastate virbonic coupling from the Cartesian energy gradient projected onto the normal modes.
* Extract the intrastate virbonic coupling from displaced geometries.
* Extract the interstate vibronic coupling from Franck-Condon Hessian calculations.
* Generate geometry scans alone dimensionless normal coordinates (DNC).
* Generate Quantics friendly outputs .
